# Exercise 04
For this exercise we will have a look at n-step methods and eligibility trace.
The environment under examination is given by the inverted pendulum, which is a popular system for toy examples of control theory.
## Tasks:
  1. discretization of continuous state spaces in order to make corresponding systems available for tabular RL algorithms
  2. on-policy epsilon-greedy control using n-step Sarsa
  3. on-policy epsilon-greedy control using TD lambda
